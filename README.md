# An App that does nothing.

This App is used to test the interaction with HWI by allowing you to mess around with the plugin.xml, click interface etc.

The app itself simply waits for a few seconds and returns. 

There are three 'modes':

1. The export creates an empty file into an assigned folder.
2. The import accepts a file and does nothing with it.
3. The 'run' waits a few seconds and returns.
